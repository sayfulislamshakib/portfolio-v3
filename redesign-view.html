						The current design of the website makes it difficult for users to
						find the information they need. The color balance is poor, which
						makes the website visually unappealing and difficult to read for
						users with vision impairments.
						<div>
							Here are some specific ways in which the poor color balance is
							impacting the user experience:
						</div>
						<div class="points">
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="points-highlight"
										>Difficulty finding information: </span
									>When the colors on a website are not well-balanced, it can
									make it difficult for users to scan the page and find the
									information they need. This is especially problematic for
									recruiters, who are often looking for specific information
									quickly.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="points-highlight">Visual discomfort: </span>Poor
									color balance can also cause visual discomfort for users,
									which can lead to them leaving the website sooner. This is
									particularly true for users with vision impairments.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="points-highlight">Accessibility issues: </span>
									Users with vision impairments may have difficulty reading text
									or distinguishing between different elements on the page if
									the color balance is poor. This makes the website inaccessible
									to a significant portion of the population.

					<div id="color-issue" class="highlight">Let's start with color</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						The current design features an improper and unbalanced use of color
						palettes, resulting in visual chaos. In addition, it has created a
						confusing and cluttered visual experience for users, which may lead
						to a lack of engagement and difficulty navigating the platform.
						Therefore, revising the colour palettes and implementing a balanced
						colour scheme will improve the overall design and user experience.

					<div class="text-normal">
						I have followed the 60-30-10 rule for applying colours in my
						redesign, which has led to a significant improvement in the visual
						hierarchy of the platform. This rule provides a balanced and
						harmonious approach to colour usage, resulting in a more
						aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly design. Furthermore, by
						adhering to this rule, I have created a better sense of visual
						organization and hierarchy, making it easier for users to navigate
						the platform and enhancing their overall experience.

						In addition to the color issues, the content cards on the website
						are not consistent in terms of color style, alignment, or size. This
						makes the website look cluttered and unprofessional, and it can be
						difficult for users to find the information they need.

							Here are some specific ways in which the lack of consistency is
							impacting the user experience:

						<div class="points">

								<li>
									<span class="points-highlight">Visual discomfort: </span>

									appealing and can cause visual discomfort for users. This can
									lead to them leaving the website sooner.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="points-highlight">Lack of engagement: </span>
									A cluttered and inconsistent website design is less likely to

						To improve the user experience, I will be unifying the style of the
						content cards and arranging any unnecessary empty spaces. This will
						make the platform more cohesive, organized, and visually appealing.
						It will also make it easier for users to navigate and find the

						<div class="points">
							<ul>
								<li>
									Make sure the menu items are spaced evenly and aligned
									correctly.
								</li>
								<li>
									Use the same font size for all of the menu items, including

						Following the alignment and contrast corrections, I modified the
