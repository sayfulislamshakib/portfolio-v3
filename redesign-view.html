					<div class="text-normal">
						The current design presents opportunities for improvement in terms
						of visual aesthetics, information presentation, accessibility, and
						user-centricity. Below are key areas where enhancements can be made
						to elevate the overall user experience:
					</div>
					<div class="points">
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">Visual Aesthetics: </span> The
								current design does not meet the desired level of visual
								perfection. Aesthetic improvements should be considered to
								create a more visually appealing and engaging user interface.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">Information Presentation: </span>
								Information is currently not optimally displayed within the
								design. Enhancements are needed to ensure that information is
								presented in a clear, organized, and user-friendly manner,
								making it easier for users to digest and interact with the
								content.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">Accessibility: </span>
								The existing design falls short in terms of accessibility. It's
								imperative to make accessibility a top priority, adhering to
								best practices and standards to ensure that all users, including
								those with disabilities, can seamlessly access and navigate the
								platform.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">User-Centric Approach: </span>
								The current design lacks consistency in information
								presentation. A user-centric approach should be adopted to
								ensure that all content and messaging are aligned with user
								expectations, needs, and preferences.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div id="problem" class="highlight">Problem</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						From a user's perspective, we can observe that users cannot obtain
						the required information accurately. The design lacks proper color
						balance, resulting in a subpar user experience and accessibility
						issues from a visual standpoint.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div id="color" class="highlight">Let's start with color</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						The current design features an improper and unbalanced use of color
						palettes, resulting in visual chaos. In addition, it has created a
						confusing and cluttered visual experience for users, which may lead
						to a lack of engagement and difficulty navigating the platform.
						Therefore, revising the colour palettes and implementing a balanced
						colour scheme will improve the overall design and user experience.

						Based on discussions with the client and primary users of the
						product, I have identified key points that require attention. To
						enhance usability for the primary users, I have undertaken a
						redesign effort that seeks to simplify the product. I have developed
						a new visual identity and comprehensive design system for all
						touchpoints to achieve this. The goal is to create a consistent,
						intuitive product experience across all channels, resulting in
						greater user satisfaction and engagement.
