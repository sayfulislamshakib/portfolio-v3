						The current design of the website makes it difficult for users to

						The current design features an improper and unbalanced use of color

						adhering to this rule, I have created a better sense of visual

						In addition to the color issues, the content cards on the website

						To improve the user experience, I will be unifying the style of the

									Rename the element to something more specific and descriptive.
									For example, you could rename it to "Account Management" or

								</li>
								<li>
									Move the element to a more logical location. For example, you
									could move it to the main navigation bar or to a dedicated
									page for account management. This will make it easier for
									users to find the element and to understand how it relates to
									the rest of the website.
								</li>
								<li>
									Update the design of the element to make it more visually
									appealing and engaging. For example, you could use different
