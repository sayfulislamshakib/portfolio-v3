						Based on discussions with the client and primary users of the
						product, I have identified key points that require attention. To
						enhance usability for the primary users, I have undertaken a
						redesign effort that seeks to simplify the product. I have developed
						a new visual identity and comprehensive design system for all
						touchpoints to achieve this. The goal is to create a consistent,
						intuitive product experience across all channels, resulting in
						greater user satisfaction and engagement.
