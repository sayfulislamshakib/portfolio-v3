					<div class="text-normal">
						The current design presents opportunities for improvement in terms
						of visual aesthetics, information presentation, accessibility, and
						user-centricity. Below are key areas where enhancements can be made
						to elevate the overall user experience:
					</div>
					<div class="points">
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">Visual Aesthetics: </span> The
								current design does not meet the desired level of visual
								perfection. Aesthetic improvements should be considered to
								create a more visually appealing and engaging user interface.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">Information Presentation: </span>
								Information is currently not optimally displayed within the
								design. Enhancements are needed to ensure that information is
								presented in a clear, organized, and user-friendly manner,
								making it easier for users to digest and interact with the
								content.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">Accessibility: </span>
								The existing design falls short in terms of accessibility. It's
								imperative to make accessibility a top priority, adhering to
								best practices and standards to ensure that all users, including
								those with disabilities, can seamlessly access and navigate the
								platform.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="points-highlight">User-Centric Approach: </span>
								The current design lacks consistency in information
								presentation. A user-centric approach should be adopted to
								ensure that all content and messaging are aligned with user
								expectations, needs, and preferences.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div id="problem" class="highlight">Problem</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						From a user's perspective, we can observe that users cannot obtain
						the required information accurately. The design lacks proper color
						balance, resulting in a subpar user experience and accessibility
						issues from a visual standpoint.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div id="color-issue" class="highlight">Let's start with color</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						The current design features an improper and unbalanced use of color
						palettes, resulting in visual chaos. In addition, it has created a
						confusing and cluttered visual experience for users, which may lead
						to a lack of engagement and difficulty navigating the platform.
						Therefore, revising the colour palettes and implementing a balanced
						colour scheme will improve the overall design and user experience.

						Color fixed with 60 - 30 - 10 rules
					</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						I have followed the 60-30-10 rule for applying colours in my
						redesign, which has led to a significant improvement in the visual
						hierarchy of the platform. This rule provides a balanced and
						harmonious approach to colour usage, resulting in a more
						aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly design. Furthermore, by
						adhering to this rule, I have created a better sense of visual
						organization and hierarchy, making it easier for users to navigate
						the platform and enhancing their overall experience.

				<div>
					<div id="layout-issue" class="highlight">Layout inconsistently</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						In addition to the colour issues, it is evident that the content
						cards lack consistency in colour style. There are inconsistencies in
						the alignment and size of elements between the cards, and some areas
						with empty spaces have been left unattended. These factors lead to a
						further decline in the visual hierarchy and negatively affect the
						interface's overall perception. Therefore, it is recommended to
						ensure that the content cards adhere to a consistent colour style
						and that the alignment and sizing of elements are uniform across all
						cards. It will create a more cohesive and organized design,
						improving the overall user experience.

						Fixed layout inconsistently
					</div>
					<div class="text-normal">
						In response to these issues, my next steps involve unifying the
						style of the content cards and arranging any unnecessary empty
						spaces. That will help to create a more cohesive and organized
						design, improving the overall user experience. By ensuring that the
						elements within each content card are consistent in size and
						alignment, users can navigate the platform more easily, leading to
						increased engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, arranging empty
						spaces will help improve the visual hierarchy, further enhancing the
						overall perception of the interface.

						Next, I shifted my focus towards the main navigation bar. Upon
						inspection, I noticed inconsistencies in the spacing and alignment
						of the menu items. Additionally, the active tab's font size was
						larger than the other items, causing further visual disruption.
						While it can be beneficial to highlight the active state, this
						design choice can increase visual chaos, particularly when combined
						with other issues, such as misaligned menu items. Furthermore, we
						need to address the colour contrast of the inactive tabs, as this
						can impact accessibility for users. By making these necessary
						changes, we can improve the overall design and create a more
						streamlined and accessible user experience for all users.

					<div class="text-normal">
						Following the alignment and contrast corrections, I modified the
						service logo's size and weight to complement the other design
						changes better. By ensuring that all elements are harmoniously
						integrated, we can create a more cohesive and visually appealing
						interface. In addition, by paying attention to even the smallest
						details, we can significantly improve the overall design and enhance
						the user experience.
